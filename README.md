# Flow-Visualisation-OpenGL
Image based flow visualisation using openGL
* A method for the visualization of two-dimensional fluid flow has been implemented in openGL. The method is based on the advection and decay of dye. These processes were simulated by defining each frame of a flow animation as a blend between a warped version of the previous image and a sequence of filtered white noise images.
