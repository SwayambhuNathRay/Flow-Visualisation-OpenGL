# Flow-Visualisation-OpenGL
Image based flow visualisation using openGL
* A method for the visualization of two-dimensional fluid flow has been implemented in openGL. The method is based on the advection and decay of dye. These processes were simulated by defining each frame of a flow animation as a blend between a warped version of the previous image and a sequence of filtered white noise images.
* Run the main.cpp file and use numeric keys and mouse clicks to play with varios types of flow visualization.
* This was done as a part of course project for DS 294: Data Analysis and Visualization.
